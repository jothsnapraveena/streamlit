# Machine Learning App Using Streamlit

Welcome to the repository  **"How to Easily Develop a Machine Learning App Using Streamlit"**! ðŸš€

In this project, I demonstrate how to build a simple machine learning web application using Streamlit. This app predicts the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements using a pre-trained RandomForest model.

This repository also has a project wine class classification based on several features
